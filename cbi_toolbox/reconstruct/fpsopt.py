"""
The fpsopt module implements algorithms to deconvolve sinograms acquired using
Focal-Plane-Scanning OPT [1].

**Conventions:**

arrays follow the ZXY convention, with

    - Z : depth axis (axial, focus axis)
    - X : horizontal axis (lateral)
    - Y : vertical axis (lateral, rotation axis when relevant)

sinograms follow the TPY convention, with

    - T : angles (theta)
    - P : captor axis
    - Y : rotation axis

    Computes the real FFT of a regularized inversed 2D PSF (or projected 3D)
    This follows the convention of fft.rfft: only half the spectrum is computed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    psf : array [ZXY] or [XY]
        The 2D PSF (if 3D, will be projected on Z axis).
    shape : tuple (int, int), optional
        Shape of the full-sized desired PSF
        (if None, will be the same as the PSF), by default None.
    l : int, optional
        Regularization lambda, by default 20
    mode : str, optional
        The regularizer used, by default laplacian.
        One of: ['laplacian', 'constant']

    Returns
    -------
    array [XY]
        The real FFT of the inverse PSF.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the PSF has incorrect number of dimensions.
